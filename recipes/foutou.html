    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In the Ivory Coast, plantain holds a privileged place in the national diet and is the base of the traditional "Foutou," the national dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 piece of cassava (manioc) about the size of a large carrot</li>
        <li>2 kg (4½ lbs) of plantains (8 or 9)</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the cassava and plantains; cut into short lengths;.</li>
        <li>Boil the cassava and plantain in unsalted water until cooked, about 20 minutes;.</li>
        <li>Cool the plantains in their cooking water;.</li>
        <li>Drain the cassava; mash in a mortar with a few drops of the cooking water to prevent it from becoming sticky; it should have the consistency of a smooth paste;.</li>
        <li>Mash the plantains separately without adding any water until smooth;.</li>
        <li>Combine the plantain and cassava; add a few drops of water if necessary to achieve the proper consistency;.</li>
        <li>Season with salt; using your hands, form the paste into balls or oval loaves;.</li>
        <li>Serve with eggplant sauce or "pépé soup".</li>
    </ol>
